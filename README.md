# COMP3005 Template Code
This is the template code for the COMP3005 Database Project.

### What to Submit:
Your task is to ONLY write your SQL queries within the prompted space within each Q_# method (where # is the question number).
In your submission repository, you are only submitting this template script "queries.py" and your dbexport.sql. Any additional submissions will ***void*** the ***entire submission.***
### How to Test:
This script will first connect to an initial database, named by the global variable "initial_database". Please change this to the name to some initially created database.
Throughout running the script, the connection is dropped from the initial database and then reconnected to an exported database, named as variable "export_database_name". This can be named whatever, but you can keep it as "query_database"

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Any alterations to the code, such as modifying the time, will be flagged for suspicion of cheating - and thus will be reviewed by the staff and, if need be, the Dean.
