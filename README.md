# COMP3005 Template Code
This is the template code for the COMP3005 Database Project.

## How Does This Work?
Your task is to ONLY write your SQL queries within the prompted space within each Q_# method (where # is the question number).

## How to Test for Yourself:
This script will first connect to an initial database, named by the global variable "initial_database" - please change this to the name to some initial database __you__ created.

Throughout running the script, the connection is dropped from the initial database, named as variable "initial_database" and then reconnected to an exported database, named as variable "export_database_name". 

### DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE DATABASES.
For the initial database, please create your own database with the same name. Otherwise, your submission will be void.
For the exported database, it is recommended to leave as is but you can rename with no penalty.

After you set these up and write your queries for each question, you can run the script which will both print the time taken (secs) and create your .csv files. 

The other prints before the execution times are printed are from the dump files, which can be ignored.

## What to Submit?
In your submission repository, you are ***only*** submitting this template script "queries.py" and *your* dbexport.sql. Any additional submissions will ***void*** the ***entire submission.***

  - What will VOID your submission?
    - Any additional submissions in your repository.
    - OTHER Print statements.
    - Alterations to code (please view below).

# ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Any alterations to the code, such as modifying the time, will be flagged for suspicion of cheating - and thus will be reviewed by the staff and, if need be, the Dean.
